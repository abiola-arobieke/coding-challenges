# Anagram Checker

Return `true` if the two given strings are anagrams. Otherwise, return `false`.

A word is an <dfn>anagram</dfn> of another word if both use the same letters in the same quantity, but arranged differently.

For example:
- `friend` and `Finder` are anagrams.
- `The Morse Code` and `Here come dots` are anagrams as well.

**Note:** You'll need to remove **all non-alphanumeric characters** (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for **anagrams**.
